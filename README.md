# Student Power
Student Power is an organization that aims to help bolster middle and elementary school education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through our website, upper classmen can sign up to become tutors and earn volunteer hours. Additionally, parents can register their children to be tutored and track their child's progress through their account.
